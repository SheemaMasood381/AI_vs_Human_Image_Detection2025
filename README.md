# AI vs Human Image Detection

This repository contains the code and models used for detecting AI-generated vs. human-created images. The project was developed for the Kaggle competition **"Can You Tell the Difference?"**, where our approach combined **ConvNeXt and Swin Transformer** in a modified **GenConViT** architecture.

🚀 **Competition Performance:**  
✅ Secured **28th position** on the **public leaderboard** 📊  
⏳ Waiting for **private leaderboard** results...  

## Features
- **Preprocessed dataset** optimized for AI vs. human image classification
- **Custom deep learning model** using **ConvNeXt + Swin Transformer**
- **Evaluation using F1-score** with a threshold of 0.5
- **Real-time inference and deployment-ready model**

## Repository Structure
- `ai-vs-human-vitconx.ipynb` - Model training and evaluation
- `ai-vs-human-VitConX final Submission.ipynb` - Final submission notebook
- `detect ai Vs human generated image.docx` - Project documentation
- `lb.PNG` - Public leaderboard snapshot

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning for **better private leaderboard performance**
- Deployment on **Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit**
- Improving explainability using **SHAP/LIME**

Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
